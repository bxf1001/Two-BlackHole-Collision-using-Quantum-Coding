##Summary Statistics:

-The mean probability is 0.005747, with a standard deviation of 0.021597.
-The median (50th percentile) is 0.000969, indicating a right-skewed distribution.
-The maximum probability is 0.215976, suggesting a dominant state.

##Top 10 Most Probable States:

The most likely state is '11111110' with a 21.5976% probability.
The second most likely is '11111111' at 17.1357%.
These high-energy states dominate, aligning with the high-energy nature of black hole collisions.

##Entropy of the System: 3.4403

This indicates a significant degree of uncertainty or randomness in the system.
Probability of high-energy outcomes: 92.28%

This extremely high percentage suggests that the simulated black hole collision predominantly results in high-energy states.
These results provide a comprehensive view of the quantum state distribution in your simulation, highlighting the prevalence of high-energy outcomes in black hole collisions. The data supports the extreme nature of these cosmic events and demonstrates the power of quantum simulation in modeling complex astrophysical phenomena.
